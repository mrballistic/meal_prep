# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

### Primary Focus: Meal Planning Feature
The meal planning interface is the current priority, with several key components under development:

1. Weekly Calendar Grid
   - Status: Basic layout implemented
   - Next: Implement drag and drop functionality
   - Blocking Issues: None

2. Save/Load Functionality
   - Status: Pending implementation
   - Dependencies: Local storage integration
   - Priority: High

3. Drag and Drop Implementation
   - Status: Pending
   - Technical Approach: Evaluating options
   - Dependencies: Calendar grid completion

## Recent Changes
