# Active Context - Meal Planning Application

## Overview
This document synthesizes the current state of development, building upon:
- Product requirements and user experience goals from productContext.md
- Architecture and patterns from systemPatterns.md
- Technical specifications from techContext.md

## Current Development Focus
_Implementing features based on the established context:_

### Primary Focus: Meal Planning Feature
_Implementing core requirements from projectbrief.md and user experience goals from productContext.md:_
The meal planning interface is the current priority, with several key components under development:

1. Weekly Calendar Grid
   - Status: Basic layout implemented
   - Next: Implement drag and drop functionality
   - Blocking Issues: None

2. Save/Load Functionality
   - Status: Pending implementation
   - Dependencies: Local storage integration
   - Priority: High

3. Drag and Drop Implementation
   - Status: Pending
   - Technical Approach: Evaluating options
   - Dependencies: Calendar grid completion

## Recent Changes
_Progress tracked against requirements from projectbrief.md:_

### Completed Features
_Features implemented according to patterns in systemPatterns.md and specifications in techContext.md:_
1. Core Infrastructure
   - Project setup and configuration
   - Dependency installation
   - Basic routing implementation
   - API service integration

2. Recipe Management
   - Search functionality
